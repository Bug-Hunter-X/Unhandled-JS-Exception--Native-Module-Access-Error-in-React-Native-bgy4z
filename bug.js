This error occurs when using a third-party library that's not correctly integrated with React Native's JavaScript environment.  Specifically, it often happens when the library tries to access native modules or perform actions that React Native doesn't support in the same way as a native Android or iOS app.  For example, trying to directly manipulate the device's camera without a proper React Native wrapper can trigger this. Another scenario is accessing a global object or function that isn't defined within React Native's context.

```javascript
// Example (Illustrative):  Incorrectly using a native module without a bridge
import { NativeModules } from 'react-native';

const { MyNativeModule } = NativeModules;

if (MyNativeModule) {
  const result = MyNativeModule.doSomething();
  console.log(result); // Error: MyNativeModule may not exist
}
```
